"Although the Christian denial isn't emphasized in the linked article, look at the following about the U.S., this is the reason for my incredulity of Christian worship of Jews. For 8 years, obama forbid Syrian Christian Refugees in the U.S., Jews are silent. Trump bans travel from certain terrorist nations, Jews around the world are rending clothing, saying banning muslim terrorists is the same as the U.S. turning away Jewish refugees prior to WWII. No Jewish protests against the ban on Christians. Folks, Jews hate Christians, or at minimum are extremely condescending towards them, they do not have Christian interests in mind. The inescapable conclusion is that Jews, of course not individually but collectively, intentionally or not, are destroying Christianity world wide, and if you push the point, every once in a while, a Jewish commenter lets leak out why they, indeed, hate Christians.  Jews are holding things they've never been subject to against modern Christians who never did it. Genealogy wise, Jews may not have a bloodline to Biblical Israel, and may never had ancestors victimized.  • Christians respect Jews.  • Jews disrespect and hate Christians. • Jews love muslims.  • Muslims hate Jews.  No room in America for Christian refugees  http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/228670-no-room-in-america-for-christian-refugees   ....The rapes of Christian women and the butchery of Christian children do not count. No matter how moved Americans were this Christmas season by the plight of their fellow Christ followers in Syria and Iraq, no matter how horrific the visuals of beheadings, enslavement, and mass murder...  The Christians are being raped, tortured, and murdered <u>by militias, not by the Syrian government. This technicality condemns them to continue to be victims without hope. And this technicality is being adhered to with all the tenacity with which President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s State Department manipulated quotas and created subterfuges to keep out the Jews fleeing the oppression of Nazi Germany. Obama no more wants the Middle East’s Christian refugees than Roosevelt wanted Europe’s Jewish refugees.  Report: ISIS Has Crucified, Tortured Thousands of Christians in Iraq, Syria  http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/09/29/report-isis-crucified-tortured-thousands-christians-iraq-syria/   barrack hussein obama, as president:  .....lashed out against the idea of giving preference to Christian refugees, describing it as shameful: That’s not American. That’s not who we are. We don’t have religious tests to our compassion, obama had added.  But, he not only lashed out against the idea of giving Christians preference, he actually arranged; by playing word games; so that Christians refugees could not enter the U.S., see the link and excerpt at the beginning of this article.  Trump said, of the Christians:  Yes. Yes, they’ve been horribly treated. If you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, or at least very, very tough, to get into the United States. If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair — everybody was persecuted, in all fairness — but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.

"Why Girls Love the Badboy (Youtube Reply):There comes a point where what women want is not going to be what men want and that will finally start to have consequences. Our society has been obsessed with what gets modern women excited, but considering women have opted for progressiveness and independence, all these notions of me me me are going to appear more and more absurd and contradictory with time. You mention all the reasons she might like the badboy and most center around security in a world that's never been more secure in history. This shows just how inflexible their wish list is, and how unwilling they are to compromise for a partner even if those compromises offer something sustainable long term. I completely understand where you're coming from and it's not women's fault for their genetic desires. But what will come at a cost to them is their blatant ignorance on what men want. Most men court women rather than passively waiting for them to approach because they're raised to believe she is better than all this. We're raised to see her as someone that values organic companionship, trust, loyalty and compatibility. Women however continue to preserve their own fantasy while completely destroying the fantasy of men. And while most men have abandoned their fantasy; showing a willingness in hard times to even dig through the junkyard scraps of single moms, sluts, feminists, and emotionally absent relics of femininity... This will eventually come to an end if women do not decide to meet us in the middle somewhere. Why? Social media has expedited the redpill in a way that even young men are being exposed to truths they shouldn't be facing till their 30's. Women in the past got they wanted by preserving some of (our) fantasy. Instead, we get Tinder results and porn, while they get their bad boys and the baggage he leaves them with.",0,0,none

Bitch, you're not the victim here. You either a) put a baby in someone who you knew or should have known would kill said baby or b) you gave babies to people with reckless disregard to whether they would kill them. It is not uncommon for this demographic to kill babies so you had a duty to vet them for their murderous tendencies. This is no different than if you hire a baby sitter who either a) you know kills children or 2) was a member of a group who had a 23% (https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2017/abortion-common-experience-us-women-despite-dramatic-declines-rates) rate of killing children and you didn't bother to ask or run a background check. If you did this you would rightfully (inb4 court shouldn't exist) be charged with negligent homicide.4) Aside from the fact that this is Alabama, I don't know how you got standing. Legally, you're just some guy. Because that's what you CHOOSE to be. You can't DNA test someone at the embryonic stage so there is no way for you to establish you status as anything other than some guy. MORALLY, you're just some guy. If I was arbitrator of AnCapistan I'd tell you to go fuck yourself and get out of my office. Even if you could establish paternity that's what I would tell you (though I have a let the chips fall where they may perspective on non established parties in abortion cases so if you dealt with it yourself I'd tell their heirs to gtfo too, and I acknowledge that that's not really an option you have under statism. But I don't gaf because you had SO many other options here.)5) This fence sitting that men do is getting retarded. (Yes, women allow it; I bitch at them enough.) You either want the title or you don't. If you want the title, then get up off your ass, get a fucking job, commit, and head the family. If you don't want the title, fine, then do what you're gonna do, but when shit doesn't go your way you have no rights because you have no responsibilities. You're not head of the family on days you feel like it. You either are or you aren't. If you choose that you aren't then you're just some guy when decisions have to be made, including non-murder-y decisions of course, because women can't rely on you so they are going to rely on themselves.6) No, I do not care more about the fact that this will create disincentives for clinics to commit feticide. Feticide (as a form of birth control anyway) is a symptom of people arranging their lives in new and interestingly stupid ways, not the other way around.

"The Founding fathers were philosemitic, many being Freemasons. The evidence that Freemasonry was introduced to North America by early Jewish immigrants from Holland who settled in Newport Rhode Island is provided by a notation written in their congregation's records which reads: On ye 5th day of ye 9th month 1658, ye 2nd Tisri A.A. 5518 Wee mett att ye House off Mordecai Campannall and after Synagog Wee gave Abm. Moses the degrees of Masonrie. In 1733, a Jew named Moses Nunis became the first person initiated into Freemasonry in Georgia at the age of 34 years. He died in 1787 and was buried with a Masonic funeral. It was into American Masonic lodges such as these that George Washington and many of the other founding fathers of the United States were inducted and initiated, as well as many of America's presidents since then. America's founding fathers conspired together in the Masonic lodges of colonial America with Jews, laying the groundwork for what would ultimately result in the thirteen colonies divorcing themselves from Great Britain. By doing so, they hoped to establish the United States as a New Jerusalem under the auspices of Freemasonry, Among Thomas Jefferson's friends was a Jewish merchant named David Isaacs, born in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1760, immigrated to Richmond, Virginia, along with his brother, Isaiah Isaacs, where he became an active member of the Jewish community, a slave-trader, and business partner in the firm of Cohen & Isaacs. David Isaacs sold the ball of twine that was used by Thomas Jefferson's overseer to lay out the first of the University of Virginia's buildings, and encouraged Thomas Jefferson in learning about the Jewish faith. Correspondence from Isaacs to Jefferson shows him offering books and pamphlets on Jewish topics in addition to other books Jefferson had asked him to obtain. Isaacs sold Jefferson meat, butter, and cheese (the very last purchase of Jefferson's life was cheese from Isaacs), wax, fish, hops, and a bright bay horse named Tecumseh. David Isaacs lived in a long-term common-law marriage Nancy West, a free woman of color who had established a bakery next to David Isaacs shop. Their daughter, Julia Ann Isaacs, married Eston Hemmings, the son of Thomas Jefferson's slave, Sally Hemmings.",1,0,none

"Chapter 1: Introduction (Part 1 of 2)… socialism, by no means an invention of nineteenth century Marxism but much older, must be conceptualized as an institutionalized interference with or aggression against private property and private property claims. Capitalism, on the other hand, is a social system based on the explicit recognition of private property and of nonaggressive, contractual exchanges between private property owners. Implied in this remark, as will become clear in the course of this treatise, is the belief that there must then exist varying types and degrees of socialism and capitalism, i.e., varying degrees to which private property rights are respected or ignored. Societies are not simply capitalist or socialist. Indeed, all existing societies are socialist to some extent. …… the overall degree of interference with property rights that exists in a given country, explains its overall wealth. The more socialist a country, the more hampered will be the process of production of new and the upkeep of old, existing wealth, and the poorer the country will remain or become. …… For one thing, in analyzing different types of socialism for which there exist real, historical examples (examples which, to be sure, very often are not called socialism, but are given a more appealing name), it is important to explain why, and in what way, every intervention anywhere, big or small, here or there, produces a particular disruptive effect on the social structure which a superficial, theoretically untrained observer, blinded by an immediate positive  consequence of a particular intervention, might not perceive. Yet this negative effect nonetheless exists, and with some delay will cause problems at a different place in the social fabric more numerous or severe than the ones originally solved by the initial act of intervening. Thus, for instance, highly visible positive effects of socialist policies such as cheap food prices, low rents, free this and free that, are not just positive things hanging in midair, unconnected to everything else, but rather are phenomena that have to be paid for somehow: by less and lower quality food, by housing shortages, decay and slums, by queuing up and corruption, and, further, by lower living standards, reduced capital-formation, and / or increased capital consumption. And a much less conspicuous but almost always positively mentioned fact — a greater feeling of solidarity among the people, the greater value attached to things like family, relatives, or friends, which is found to exist between, for instance, the East Germans as compared to their more individualistic, egoistic West / German counterparts — is again not a simple, isolated, unanalyzable fact. Such feelings are the result of a social system of constant shortages and of continually repressed opportunities to improve one’s situation by one’s own means. In East Germany, in order to accomplish the most simple routine tasks, such as a house repair which in other countries requires no more than a telephone call, you simply must rely more heavily on personal relations (as compared to impersonal business relations); and where someone’s public life is under constant observation by society, you simply have to go private. …",1,0,none

"CONT 4Pese a tratarse, como ya se apuntara anteriormente, del círculo más externo de esta entidad, lo tratado en sus cumbres periódicas ofrece una clara idea de sus objetivos. Así, en la Conferencia celebrada en junio de 1991 en la localidad alemana de Baden-Baden, sus más conspicuos militantes celebraron el desarrollo de la Guerra del Golfo, cuyo desenlace estaba entonces reciente, como un paso importante para sacar a los americanos del nacionalismo. Sobre este particular se pronunció Henry Kissinger, uno de los ponentes, haciendo notar el avance de años que había supuesto el hecho de que la intervención norteamericana en el conflicto hubiera sido acordada en la ONU antes de obtener el refrendo del Congreso norteamericano, único órgano facultado para declarar la guerra según lo dispuesto por la Constitución de ese país, añadiendo que si los americanos pueden ser persuadidos de traspasar las decisiones bélicas a la ONU, los nacionalismos de vía estrecha de Francia, Gran Bretaña o cualquier otro país desaparecerán. El júbilo de Kissinger y de sus ilustres cofrades estaba plenamente justificado si se considera que la ONU no es sino uno de sus organismos títere. Como colofón de este rápido repaso bueno será dedicar algunas palabras a uno de los pasatiempos predilectos de los bilderberger. Se trata de lo que, en la jerga de la organización, es conocido como juegos de guerra, un significativo eufemismo mediante el que se designan ciertas prácticas que ya desde tiempo antes venía desarrollando el Consejo de Relaciones Exteriores. Básicamente, los llamados juegos de guerra consisten en la escenificación de situaciones de crisis extrema sobre asuntos de política internacional, a fin de tener previstas todas las posibles contingencias que pudieran representar un obstáculo para el desenlace deseado. Los seminarios o foros de reflexión donde se desenvuelven estos juegos suelen celebrarse en lugares apartados bajo los auspicios de instituciones académicas tales como el Instituto Averell Harriman, el Consejo de Yale sobre Estudios Internacionales o la Academia para el Desarrollo de la Educación, todas ellas vinculados a la sociedad The Order, de la que se hablará más adelante. Los participantes en estos seminarios son, por lo regular, expertos reclutados en las altas esfera científicas y académicas y vinculados a las figuras clave de la política exterior de sus respectivos países. Paralelamente a los juegos de guerra se desarrollan los juegos políticos, complementándose ambos mutuamente. En realidad, el juego de guerra se pone en marcha cuando sobrevienen o son introducidos en un juego político acontecimientos críticos, como golpes de Estado, graves disturbios sociales, magnicidios, invasiones, etc. Y si bien los juegos de guerra están concebidos para tener previstas todas las eventualidades posibles y las soluciones más adecuadas a cada una de ellas, a veces ocurre que el acontecimiento real (ya sea espontáneo, ya provocado) se desarrolla de forma distinta a la prevista en el juego, en cuyo caso se hace preciso intervenir, si es necesario directamente, para corregir los desvíos y reconducir el proceso hacia el desenlace adecuado ",1,0,none

"CLUB DE SATANICOS BILDERBERG, LOS AMOS DEL MUNDOHISTORIA DEL CLUB DE BILDERBERG: El sistema financiero mundial y sus núcleos de poder.La más secreta de las logias del poder mundial toma su nombre de un hotel en la ciudad holandesa de Oosterbeek, donde se efectuó su primera reunión en mayo de 1954. En plena guerra fría, fue creada por el príncipe Bernardo de Holanda para que los dirigentes de los EE.UU y Europa pudieran mantener conversaciones en reserva y coordinar políticas....¿ Por que se desconoce que entre otros, el hombre de PRISA, Juan Luis Cebrían, ex director ideólogo del diario progresita ´EL PAIS´, asiste a estas reuniones secretas? ( ver artículos de solidaridad.net sobre este tema)El grupo Bilderberg nació oficialmente en mayo de 1954, fecha en la que tuvo lugar en la localidad holandesa de Oosterbeek la primera Conferencia de esta entidad con la participación de un centenar de destacadas figuras del mundo económico, político, académico y mediático. El anfitrión de aquella sesión inaugural, celebrada en los salones del hotel Bilderberg, de donde procede el nombre del grupo, fue el príncipe Bernardo de Holanda, un personaje estrechamente vinculado a los altos círculos financieros y políticos occidentales. Desde que echara a andar, el mensaje difundido por los mentores del Bilderberg Group fue el característico de este tipo de organismos: se trataba, según el comunicado oficial, de una entidad destinada a fortalecer la unidad atlántica, a frenar el expansionismo soviético y a fomentar la cooperación y el desarrollo económico de los países del área occidental. Todo lo cual no era más que una forma eufemística de describir los objetivos reales de la organización, perfectamente conocidos a tenor del contenido de sus reuniones. Y es que, a pesar del hermetismo en el que se desarrollan éstas, nunca han faltado las filtraciones reveladoras sobre el particular. En el seguimiento de las reuniones y andanzas de esta emérita cofradía merece destacarse la labor que, desde hace tiempo, viene realizando el rotativo estadounidense The Spotlight, cuyas valiosas informaciones han sido fundamentales para saber que tales objetivos se resumen en uno, cual es el cercenamiento progresivo de las soberanías nacionales y su transferencia a instituciones de carácter oligárquico y supranacional. Pero antes de seguir adelante convendrá escudriñar en los orígenes de esta entidad, en los que aparece como eminencia gris e instigador un personaje de escasa resonancia pública, pero de enorme peso en los más discretos y selectos círculos del Poder. Se trata de Joseph Retinger, un sujeto a quien el propio Bernardo de Holanda rendiría homenaje fúnebre con estas palabras: La historia conoce numerosos personajes notables sobre los cuales se concitó durante su vida la atención general. Ellos fueron admirados y festejados por todos, y nadie ignoró su nombre.... Existen, sin embargo, otros hombres cuya influencia es todavía mayor, incidiendo con su personalidad en el tiempo en que vivieron, aunque no son conocidos, pese a todo, más que por un círculo de iniciados muy restringido. Joseph Retinger fue uno de éstos. (Bulletin nº 5 du Centre de Culture Europeèn). ",1,0,none
